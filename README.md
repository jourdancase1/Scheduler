# Simple workday scheduler
## How it works
* Simple block calendar that represents a typical business day
* The day is shown in hour time blocks.
* Each time block is color coded to indicate whether it occurs in the past (gray), present (red) or future green.
* Each time block has an input field and a save button
* Appointments can be entered to a specific hour inline, and the 'save' button saves them to local storage.
* This application uses jquery and moment.js, and Bootstrap.
